# Tech Conference T-Level Project

## About
This is an assignment I was given for my T-Level course to learn about front-end and back-end development. 
The website is for a fake tech conference in Bromley and contains:

  • A home page
  
  • Login page
  
  • Registration page
  
  • Profile page

## Instructions
  1. Install the required dependacies in 'requirements.txt'. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  2. Make sure you're in the 'src' directory. Use `cd` in the terminal and then the path.
  3. Type `uvicorn main:app` and click on the link in the terminal.
